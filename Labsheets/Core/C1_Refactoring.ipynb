    "# Check Point 1: Refactoring Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done for reaching Check Point 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in your coursework you should feel quite confident that your robot can follow the line.  You  should also have your robot autonomously switching between a few different behaviours, e.g., initialising, finding a line, following a line, and stopping.  There are other challenges in the coursework we haven't started to solve yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any software development process, half of the challenge is understanding the task you are trying to solve.  As such, it is normal to write quite messy code as you try things out, explore the task and various techniques.  However, from this point onwards, your code is going to be getting a lot more complicated.  That means the bugs you encounter are going to be getting a lot harder to track down and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics that is an even more challenging problem because robots are complicated and prone to failure outside of the software (e.g., electronics, mechanics, environment, or even our human understanding of the task).  Therefore, it is **extremely good practice** to keep your code as neat and as well thought out as possible.  In robotics, your code is one of the few parts that you can have a lot of control over.  When we increase the complexity of our robot, environment, or task, we want to be confident our prior work is robust - we don't want any unnecessary errors to make our jobs as roboticists harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few labsheets are going to investigate increasingly complex behaviours - your code is going to be interacting with the real world and producing unexpected results. Therefore, we need the code you have so far to be robust (e.g., you have tested it, and it works well), and clean (e.g., anyone could read it and help you search for and solve problems).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Please do not under-estimate how much time you will save with a practice of good clean code.  Sometimes it is even quicker to start again from scratch.\n"

    "## Have a tidy!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by taking a back-up, or creating a new copy of your current project code.\n",
    "- Start deleting all the code you're not actually using in this project.  Don't worry, it still exists in your back-up!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Don't rush!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look at **Labsheet 4: Finite State Machine** to see how you could begin to organise your code neatly.  Sometimes you'll save time in the long run by reviewing and improving your code, reducing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naming Conventions**: Look for any variables named like `temp1`, `a`, `i`, etc, and give them better names.  You should be able to understand why a variable exists from its name.  The same is true for function names, class names, and other declared names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repetition**:  Whenever the same lines of code are being used more than twice, you should consider moving them into a re-usable function routine with a good name.  \n",
    "    - A good example of this is setting the power to your motors.  It is much better to call a function which will consistently set the motors in the same way.\n",
    "    - This means, if there is a bug in this piece of code, it now only occurs within your function.  If you don't do this, you'd have to search for all the instances you've copied-and-paste the lines of code when you need to make a change or find a bug.\n",
    "    - It will make your code very easy to read, because it will look closer to natural language (e.g, a function called, setMotorPower(), is easier to understand).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Sequences**: If you code has a long sequence of operations, you should consider relocating these into a function.  This will leave only a (well named) function call where the sequence was.\n",
    "    - This will help with the readability of your code.  Debugging has a lot to do with understanding what is or isn't happening. \n",
    "    - It is also easier to comment out a function call - sometimes temporarily removing code can help to isolate a bug (e.g, if the bug suddenly goes away, you've found where it lives!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Calculations**: When we are working on a microcontroller, it can be difficult to check that operations are occuring as we think they are.  Instead of doing a complicated calculation all on one line, break it across many lines and many variables.  \n",
    "    - Consider the operation taking place (division?) and whether it is suited to the variable type.\n",
    "    - Remember that operations will take place on the right-hand side of a line of code, before being stored into the left-hand side.  Therefore, assume the calculation operates within the type determined by the variables on the right-hand side. \n",
    "        - e.g, dividing two int's will take place as int's, even if you are assigning into a float.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```C++\n",
    "            float my_result = my_int_a / my_int_b; // This calculation will likely perform as an int.\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Microcontrollers are not forgiving about the **type** of your variables.  \n",
    "    - In many places in your project, you'll have mixed types.  <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/cast\">Typecast where appropriate.</a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Long if() statements**:  You might combine lots of conditions with && or || operators.  It can be difficult to know which are working properly, or as you expect.\n",
    "    - Consider breaking these up into several if() statments.  Nested if() statements operate like the && operator.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```C++\n",
    "    if( a == true ) {\n",
    "            if( b == true ) {\n",
    "                // This is functionally the same as \n",
    "            // a == true && b == true\n",
    "                        \n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Remember to use elseif() to catch the alternative conditions.\n",
    "    - Remember to use else to catch a condition which either shouldn't happen (an error), or is the only alternative.\n",
    "    - Remember that consecutive if() statements (one after another) could over-ride each other, leading to unpredictable behaviour.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```C++\n",
    "if( a == true ) {\n",
    "    stop();\n",
    "} \n",
    "\n",
    "if( a == true || b == true ) {  \n",
    "    // because a is true again, stop() will look like\n",
    "    // it never happened.\n",
    "    go();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Magic Numbers**: if you see numbers throughout your code to make initialisation, selection or evaluation, you should move them to `#define` or `const` values at the top of your program.\n",
    "    - It is easy to forget that we set a magic number somewhere, and wonder why the robot is behaving so badly.\n",
    "    - It is much more convenient to adjust the performance of your solution by going straight to the top of your program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Blocking Code**: blocking code can be a disaster.  It is important that as much as possible, you understand and can predict the flow and timing (sequence) of your code.  e.g. You do not want your code to \"sometimes\" get stuck in a 500ms delay.\n",
    "    - Avoid using delay() at all costs.  You should be using millis() to sequence events (labsheet 2) in your code so that the microcontroller can process other tasks.\n",
    "    - Avoid using for() or while() loops as much as possible.  Time spent in an iterative-loop will stop your microcontroller from moving through the other tasks you had planned.  Instead, utilise the fact that the Arduino will always iterate through loop() automatically, and use this to periodically update or incrementally process your input/output or data.\n",
    "    - A big problem with Blocking Code comes when you remove it - blocking code may have been slowing your code down all along, and now it is gone, your code operates too quickly and changes the behaviour of your robot.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Serial**: Sadly, without better tools, it is common to use Serial.print() to debug code on Arduino.  This is a problem because **Serial is Blocking code**!\n",
    "    - Use Serial sparingly, ideally only to debug.\n",
    "    - Once you're confidence something is working, remove or comment out the Serial operations.\n",
    "    - Be prepared that when you remove or comment out Serial, you code may operate with a different speed.  To help reduce this factor, use the millis() techniques to control the sequencing of your code as discussed in Labsheet 2.\n",
    "    - If you see a significant and definite malfunction when you are and are not using Serial, check Labsheet 0 Troubleshooting for a work around.\n",
    "    - Consider using a `#define SERIAL_DEBUG 1` at the top of your code, and the if(){} blocks in your code which only activiate when SERIAL_DEBUG == 1.  This makes it easier to toggle the use of Serial in your code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Classes**: If you have a lot of functions to operate on a similar subject, it is worthwhile creating a class.  This is also true if you have a lot of variables relating to a subject.  \n",
    "    - A class can make your code more readable, which can help to then spot bugs.  \n",
    "    - A class will also locate your bugs within encapsulated code.  This means, for example, you can debug by commenting out your references to a class and see if a bug goes away.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Exceptions**: For each function your write, you should consider what the exceptions would be (ways it would produce an error).  A function to set the power of your motors is a good example:\n",
    "    - What variable type does the function expect as an argument?\n",
    "    - What is a sensible range for these variable(s)?\n",
    "    - What should your function do if it is called inappropriately? e.g., given the wrong value as input?\n",
    "    - What are the limits of the output your function should produce? e.g., analogWrite() works with a range of `[ 0 : 255 ]`.\n",
    "    - Even writing comments out to state these types of errors can help you to catch bugs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behaviours**: At this point in the coursework, you are beginning to define and test autonomous behaviours.  It is worthwhile creating (or maintaining) versions of your code which only operate a single behaviour.  \n",
    "    - These should be your `gold standard` for each behaviour, just in case something goes seriously wrong in the future.  \n",
    "    - By keeping a version of each of your behaviours separate, you can be confident of when or where a bug is occuring in an integrated version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Comments**: As you go about refactoring, comment your code! \n",
    "    - Writing comments will help you to think about what your code does, and if it makes sense.\n",
    "    - Commenting your code will help you understand it next week, or next month, or next year.\n"
